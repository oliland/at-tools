**However**, there's now a pretty gui interface! Simply run cascader-gui, and follow the onscreen prompts.

## Functionality ##
- Search for Cascaders on your floor
- Cascade, specifying username and topics.
- Minimize to system tray: you can close the main window and still access all functions from the tray.
- Tray icon changes when cascading.
- Graphical map of your lab and where cascaders are, if there are cascaders in your lab.
- Dialog to inform me of new machines via email, making it quicker to build the lab maps.

## Future functionality ##
- Maybe a messaging interface? Anyone got some ideas for it?
